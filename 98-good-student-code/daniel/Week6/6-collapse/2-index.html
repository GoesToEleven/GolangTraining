	<iron-collapse id="one">The Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS) was developed to measure basic essential skills in the academic content area domains of Reading, Mathematics, Science, and English and Language Usage. These entry level skills were deemed important for nursing program applicants by a nursing program curriculum expert. Students must earn an overall score of 62% or higher to submit an application to the Registered Nursing and LVN to RN Program. Students who earn an overall score below 62% may enroll into remediation workshops within the Health Sciences Division at FCC.

	<iron-collapse id="four">Family Child Care is the term used for child care that is provided in a home setting for three or more unrelated children.

A licensed family child care home may provide care for up to six children, including the provider's own children. Currently, family child care providers must complete 15 hours of child health and safety training. This requirement is fulfilled by Child Development 6, but may also be fulfilled by non-credit training offered through Red Cross or the American Heart Association.</iron-collapse>
