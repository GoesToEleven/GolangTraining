 We used shorthand notation:
 to create a variable named p1 of type person
 to create a variable named p2 of type person
 We initialized those variables with specific values
 We used the short variable declaration operator with a struct literal to initialize
 ----------------------------------------
 here is how we talk about structs:
 -- user defined type
 -- we declare the type
 -- the type has fields
 -- the type can also have "tags"
 ----  we haven't seen this yet
 -- the type has an underlying type
 ---- in this case, the underlying type is struct
 -- we declare variables of the type
 -- we initialize those variables
 ---- initialize with a specific value, or
 ---- or, initiliaze to the zero value
 -- a struct is a composite type

 Bill Kennedy:
 Go allows us the ability to declare our own types.
 Struct types are declared by composing a fixed set of unique fields together.
 Each field in a struct is declared with a known type.
 This could be a built-in type or another user defined type.
 Once we have a type declared, we can create values from the type
 When we declare variables, the value that the variable represents is always initialized.
 The value can be initialized with a specific value or it can be initialized to its zero value
 For numeric types, the zero value would be 0; for strings it would be empty;
 and for booleans it would be false.
 In the case of a struct, the zero value would apply to all the different fields in the struct.
 Anytime a variable is created and initialized to its zero value, it is idiomatic to use the keyword var.
 Reserve the use of the keyword var as a way to indicate that a variable is being set to its zero value.
 If the variable will be initialized to something other than its zero value,
 then use the short variable declaration operator with a struct literal
